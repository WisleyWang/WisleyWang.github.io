== About me
I am currently a Ph.D student at [https://www.uestc.edu.cn/ UESTC] and my supervisor is [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37281040000 Prof. Yifan Chen]. I received the master's degree from UESTC in 2021. After graduating with a master's degree, I worked as an intelligent algorithm engineer in a company for two years. After that, I continued to pursue a doctoral degree in 2023.

My research interests include: 
- Artificial Intelligence for Science: Electromagnetic inverse problem, wearable sensing, brain-computer interface（BCI）etc.
- Computer Vision
- Large Language Models
